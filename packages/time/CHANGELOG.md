# @kete-africa/time

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- The time of the organization (spec 102, step L4). `@kete-africa/time` computes when dated facts
  happen (`occurrences`, `placeInDays`), what clashes (`conflicts`: expected while away, two places
  at once), a person's free time (`freeSlots`) and blocks for her tasks before their day
  (`proposeBlocks`, on the half hour); `icsAgenda` reads her own agenda as « busy » facts.
  `@kete-africa/center` says an app's dated facts (`sendDatedFact`, `dropDatedFact`).
  `@kete-africa/design` draws them: `WeekCalendar`, `AgendaList`, `TeamLanes`.
