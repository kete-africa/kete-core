# @kete-africa/lifecycle

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Every package published again together, so each one pins the current versions of the others: an app
  installs one copy of `@kete-africa/capabilities`, `@kete-africa/commands` and `@kete-africa/sdk`; some
  packages had kept the versions of the day they were last published.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- The lifecycle (spec 105, step L7). `@kete-africa/lifecycle` keeps skills, agents and apps with
  their owner, version, tier and test cases, and the lessons their use taught — gathered with
  consent, kept as test cases or dropped by their owner — promoted one tier at a time with a review by
  their risk (`/server`); and, pure, an agent's six states, budget, triggers and autonomy earned by
  proofs. `@kete-africa/time` now holds routines (`nextRun`), which `@kete-africa/boards` re-exports.
  `@kete-africa/design` adds `AgentCard`, `LessonCard` and `TierLadder`.
