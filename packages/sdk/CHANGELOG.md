# @kete-africa/sdk

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- aa87c98: The app contract (spec 049): an app declares its permissions with their words and default roles,
  the classification of its capabilities and data sets, the events it emits, the subjects it asks
  decisions for and its client id. `@kete/center` reads a person's grants at Kete Enterprise;
  `createRights` follows them once the organization manages the app's rights.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 77cfb71: The integration contract (spec 045): `dataset.v1` and the manifest's `datasets` and `endpoints`;
  `defineDataset`, `createDatasetRegistry` and `createHttpApi` serve an app's capabilities and data
  sets over HTTP under the caller's rights; `exposeRecord` turns a record type into `{type}_list` and
  `{type}_get`. A new app's template exposes its tasks, mounts its API at `/api/v1` and declares
  everything in its manifest.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 09f35ee: `manifest.v1` carries an app's identity card (doctrine D-040), optional and additive: `governance`
  with its owner, data categories, use of AI and criticality. `createApp` and
  `pnpm create @kete-africa/app` now require `--owner`, written into the new app's card.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 69bd40a: The `capability.v1` contract: the `Capability` type and `validateCapability`; a manifest may now
  list its `capabilities` (optional, additive).
- dc09e1d: Views in copilots (MCP Apps, doctrine D-037). `capability.v1` names a capability's view; the MCP
  handler serves views as `ui://` resources, names each tool's view, and lets the person decide a
  draft in the view (`kete_draft_review`, `kete_draft_validate`, `kete_draft_refuse`, visible to the
  view only), level 4 staying in the product's screen; `registry.review` and `registry.decide`;
  protected resource metadata (RFC 9728). New package `@kete/views`: the generic views (draft review,
  form, table, detail) as one self-contained page. A new actor channel, `view`. `@kete/design`
  exports `base.css`, its styles without font files.
