# @kete-africa/capabilities

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- aa87c98: The app contract (spec 049): an app declares its permissions with their words and default roles,
  the classification of its capabilities and data sets, the events it emits, the subjects it asks
  decisions for and its client id. `@kete/center` reads a person's grants at Kete Enterprise;
  `createRights` follows them once the organization manages the app's rights.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 77cfb71: The integration contract (spec 045): `dataset.v1` and the manifest's `datasets` and `endpoints`;
  `defineDataset`, `createDatasetRegistry` and `createHttpApi` serve an app's capabilities and data
  sets over HTTP under the caller's rights; `exposeRecord` turns a record type into `{type}_list` and
  `{type}_get`. A new app's template exposes its tasks, mounts its API at `/api/v1` and declares
  everything in its manifest.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Follows the new versions of `@kete-africa/commands` and `@kete-africa/sdk`: a package pins the
  exact versions of its `@kete-africa` dependencies when it is published, so an app never gets two
  copies of the command journal.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 69bd40a: First release: capabilities with their autonomy level (1 to 4), a registry that invokes them under
  the host's rights for every surface, their tools for model runtimes, and a stateless MCP endpoint as
  a web-standard handler.
- dc09e1d: Views in copilots (MCP Apps, doctrine D-037). `capability.v1` names a capability's view; the MCP
  handler serves views as `ui://` resources, names each tool's view, and lets the person decide a
  draft in the view (`kete_draft_review`, `kete_draft_validate`, `kete_draft_refuse`, visible to the
  view only), level 4 staying in the product's screen; `registry.review` and `registry.decide`;
  protected resource metadata (RFC 9728). New package `@kete/views`: the generic views (draft review,
  form, table, detail) as one self-contained page. A new actor channel, `view`. `@kete/design`
  exports `base.css`, its styles without font files.
