## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Published again on the current versions of the packages it depends on.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d8913af: Threads people live in (spec 139): `message.v1` says `visibility` and `moved_from`, `holding.v1` a `priority`, `snoozed_until` and a holding waited on; `@kete/threads` gives unread counts and marks, members and mentions, files with versions, moved messages and live changes (`threadsLiveMigrationSql`, `threadSummariesOf`, `listenThreads`, `changesSince`); `@kete/channels` answers on WhatsApp in its 24-hour window or by template (`answerByChat`); `@kete/work` priorities, snoozes and nudges by priority (`workPrioritiesMigrationSql`); `@kete/time` her days as an iCalendar feed (`icsFeed`); `@kete/drafts` a draft anyone can read (`describeDraft`); `@kete/policies` the six policies as templates and their simulation; `@kete/center` an app object's thread (`openObjectThread`); settings for nudges, the threads' digest and WhatsApp's template.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Every package published again together, so each one pins the current versions of the others: an app
  installs one copy of `@kete-africa/capabilities`, `@kete-africa/commands` and `@kete-africa/sdk`; some
  packages had kept the versions of the day they were last published.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Proposals and voice (spec 104, step L6). `@kete-africa/drafts` keeps proposal sets — applied
  together by one gesture, a level 4 item waiting for its own confirmation, undone together
  (`proposeSet`, `applySet`, `dismissSet`, `undoSet`, `proposalSetsMigrationSql`). `@kete-africa/ai`
  understands a note as gestures on the objects the app knows (`understand`), never guessed.
  `@kete-africa/notify` gives a message's words, a voice note written by the dictation port
  (`wordsOf`). `@kete-africa/sdk`: a proposal's item carries its capability's `input` (additive).
  `@kete-africa/design` adds `ProposalList` and `VoiceCapture`. A generated app closes its day at
  `/soir`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- A field's provenance may carry its `quote`: the passage it was read in, which the person checks it
  against (spec 098).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Follows the new versions of `@kete-africa/commands` and `@kete-africa/sdk`: a package pins the
  exact versions of its `@kete-africa` dependencies when it is published, so an app never gets two
  copies of the command journal.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0dce116: First release: record drafts and change proposals with each field's provenance, corrected and then
  validated or refused by a person only, frozen by the database once decided.
